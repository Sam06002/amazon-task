"This scale is the best scale I have ever owned. Was packed and shipped in excellent condition and on time. Numbers on read-out are easy to see. Weight is very accurate. I would buy this again! If you are looking, your search is over. Buy it today! It is a quality scale. I like that the scale can be used for both kitchen and bathroom.

"Received with cap broken and poorly taped up. Box was not well packaged. Item was in great condition.
Very nice. Perfect for my daughter’s birthday gift. Will be ordering from you again. Thank you so much.
I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. She loved it. She was very surprised. It was shipped very quickly and was packaged very well. I will definitely order from this seller again. Thank you.
Beautiful, but my daughter is not a huge fan of the color. It is a bit darker than the picture. She loves it, though."
"Great worked perfectly for me. I had been getting errors trying to do it the other way (make a copy of the html file) and it didn't work either. Thanks.
I am getting the error ""Object doesn't support property or method 'getElementById'"". I tried to copy the code to a html file and use that and it works fine. I am just trying to do it in my existing html file.
I am getting the error ""Object doesn't support property or method 'getElementById'"". I tried to copy the code to a html file and use that and it works fine. I am just trying to do it in my existing html file. Is there any way I can get this to work?
Thank you for your help. I am still getting an error. I am using a php file to link to the html file. I am not sure if that is causing the error.

"I used it 3 times and it already shows 'low battery'...<br />and it's not eligible for return..<br />so I guess I'll just keep it for a couple of months and then just throw it away...<br />
What a waste of money.<br />
I don't recommend this product at all.<br />
Hmm... I just bought it and charged it up... and it seems like it really doesn't last a long time...<br />
For the price, I expected a better battery life.<br />
I bought this a week ago and I have been using it everyday and the battery life is not good.<br />
I don't know if the battery is just weak or if it is the way it is made but it doesn't last more than 2 days.<br />
I use it for less than an hour a day and it is already showing low battery.<br />
I have to charge it almost everyday.<br />
This product is just a waste of money.<br />
I bought it last week and the battery life is just not good at all.<br"
"Thrilled with this stuff. I was skeptical at first, but I love it. I use it for my eye makeup and my mascara. I love how it stays on, I don't need to reapply my mascara. I don't have to reapply my eye makeup and I have a lot of allergies, so I get a lot of eye issues, and this stuff is amazing. I highly recommend it. It's a little expensive, but it's a little goes a long way.
I use this as a primer for my foundation. I have very dry skin and this product does a good job of keeping my foundation in place and it feels nice on my skin. I have used this product for several years and I will continue to use it.
I have tried several primers over the years. I usually have a good experience with them. I have a few that I really love, but this one is a little different. I love that it is not greasy and it gives a nice glow to my skin. I"
"Tastes great. I use as alternative to fish oil to help my chronic dry eye! I will definitely be ordering again.
I have been using this product for over a year. I am happy with the results. I have a lot less inflammation and my skin is more hydrated. I use this for my face and my hands. It is a great product.
This product is amazing! I have a very dry skin and I suffer from eczema. I have tried many different brands and nothing worked until I tried this. I use it every day and it has improved my skin. I love it!
I use this every day, it works so well! My skin is softer, smoother and has a healthy glow! I am so happy with this product!
I really like this product, it is very effective. I have tried other products but this is the one I keep coming back to. I have very dry skin and this has helped a lot!
I use this every night and my skin looks and feels so much better. It is very effective and I will keep buying"
"Took two rounds of these, didn't make a difference. My doc prescribed Elavil for a year, I took it for 3 weeks and it worked. The doctor didn't want to prescribe it for me because he said he knew what it did to people and I didn't need it. I told him I have a history of suicide and he said ""well you didn't commit suicide"" I said well I tried. I told him that if I had committed suicide he would have said ""well I knew she was going to do that"". So I quit taking it. I didn't know it was the Elavil. I had been taking the anti-seizure meds for 20 years and the anti-seizure meds did the same thing. I had to go to the hospital to get the seizure meds changed because I was having a bad reaction to the new meds and the doctor said it was the Elavil. I thought it was the seizure meds and I was right. I have never been able to tolerate El"
"If you know what this does, you know why it's necessary to some of us. For me, it replaces TWO THIRDS of the expensive daily dose of 5-HTP I needed to remain depression-free.<br /><br />The pills are a bit large, and this med smells like old socks when you open the jar (every time you do so). It doesn't taste bad, though, and it's worth it.<br /><br />You can also get it in a liquid form, which I used to take. But I couldn't stand the taste of the liquid, so I switched to the pills.<br /><br />And I don't think I can ever go back to the liquid.<br /><br />I've been taking this for several years, and it's the only thing that keeps me depression-free. I love it.<br /><br />I don't know if I could get it without a prescription, but I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. This med works for me, and I hope it works for you too.
I have been taking this product for about 2 years now. I take it with the melatonin. The combination has helped me sleep and stay asleep. I have also noticed that I have not had any night sweats. I will continue to take this product.
I take this to help me sleep. It works great, I only take it at night, and have been taking it for"

"It seemed to work okay. It was a little difficult to get set-up with the app. However, the next day I went to use it again and it wouldn't work. It wasn't the batteries, it just stopped working. I liked it when it was working. It was cool and useful to see all the information in the app. But it stopped working so quickly - we are returning it."
"It’s very affordable. You can get a small package for as low as $35, which is more than enough for the average home. You can also get a larger package if you have more than one pet. It doesn’t matter how many pets you have or what kind of breed they are. The spray works for all kinds of pets, including cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, hamsters, and more. It’s also very easy to use. You can use it on your pet without having to worry about them getting hurt."
"the vitamin gummies were all stuck together and hard to get unstuck from the wrapper. I ended up having to cut off the end of one of them to get it to come out. It was a pain in the ass. I know the company was probably having a hard time due to the pandemic, but I hope they work on the gummies a bit more for next time. I would still recommend this product, but the gummies need to be better."

"I was looking for prenatal vitamin that had the addition of DHA and this one came up as highly recommended.  In my case, there has never been a aftertaste or any digestive issues.  I like thats it is just 2x a day as opposed to other prenatals that are 3x."
"Gives the hair a glossy, oily shine that I like. I used it for a week straight and the smell is nice. The only thing is that I don't know how to wash it out. My hair is fine and gets tangled easily. I would recommend this product.
I love this product! I have used it for a year now and I can't live without it! I use it every day and my hair is so healthy and soft. I have naturally wavy/curly hair and it is so much easier to style now that my hair is so soft and healthy. It also makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking. It smells great, too. I love the size of the bottle, too. I can easily put it in my purse for on the go use. I highly recommend this product!
This stuff is amazing. I have long, wavy, dry, color treated hair and it has made my hair soft and manageable. It smells great and has a nice, light hold. I am a big fan"
"Good for me!! My vitamin D count was low...this stuff works great!! The flavor is good and I mix it with some orange juice and have it every morning. I take the whole bottle in one day and then the next day I take a little less. My Dr. says that if I take too much at once, I will have a calcium overdose. So far so good. Thank you!!"
"i still tast a little bit of seed.<br />but my husband and son love it.<br /><br />my husband said he feels diffrent in good way.<br /><br />i love the taste.<br /><br />i will try to make it more smooth and maybe add some milk.<br /><br />thank you for the recipe.<br /><br />i will try the other recipes also.<br /><br />thank you
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful chia seed pudding recipe. I made it for my family last night and they loved it! I will be making it again. I have been looking for a good chia seed pudding recipe for a while now.<br />Thank you again!"
"Perfect to layer with other lotions<br />Good and thick<br />Love it
Bought this after reading reviews and it did not disappoint! My skin feels soft and moisturized. I will be buying this again!
This is the only body lotion I use. It smells wonderful, and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day. I have very dry skin and this lotion is so good. I highly recommend this product!
I love this lotion! I have tried others that cost twice as much and none of them compare to this one. The smell is amazing and it keeps my skin so soft.
I love this lotion! It smells so good, and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I use this all over my body and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy.
This is a very nice lotion. I use it on my hands and feet and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. I like the scent of it as well. It is a very nice lotion!

"Tablets are great but just big enough to be annoying, small enough to be unusable. The iPad is just right.
Yeah, I read that too. I was looking at the 7 inch Kindle Fire as well, but the screen resolution is so low, it just looks awful. Plus, it is still a Kindle Fire, so I wouldn’t be able to use my iPhone apps. I guess I’m just spoiled by the iPad.
I just wanted to say thanks for the awesome commentary. You really bring up some great points about the iPad and the way it is being marketed. I don’t have a problem with the iPad, but I do have a problem with the way Apple is promoting it. I think that the iPad is a great device, but it is not a replacement for my laptop. I think that the iPad is a great device to have, but it is not going to replace my laptop anytime soon.
I agree with you on all points. I have a MacBook Pro and my iPad is"
"This is the 3rd bottle ive bought that i use for massage therapy. I highly recommend this product and this seller. Great customer service!
I absolutely love this product. I use it to rub on my legs and arms to help with the skin of my legs and arms. It is great. I will definitely be ordering more.
I have been using this product for awhile and it is amazing! I use it for a daily body lotion and it keeps my skin hydrated all day long!
I’ve been using this product for years and have never been disappointed. It smells wonderful and my skin feels so soft. I even use it on my face.
I use this as a daily body moisturizer and my skin feels soft and smooth. I like the smell and the consistency. I highly recommend this product.
I have very sensitive skin and have tried several products. This is by far my favorite. It has a nice scent and I use it every day.
I love this product. I have used it for years. I have very dry skin and this product helps keep it moist"
I thought these would be veggie capsules but they are tablets which are hard for me to digest. They do not taste nice either.
"They work great, and seem well made. Capping is always tedious, but these work well. I got the largest capsules so can only swallow one at time. I'm trying to get them down as quickly as possible to avoid spitting them out.
I had to order these in the larger size because the small size was too small to swallow. The large capsules are great, easy to swallow, and I feel that they are helping with my symptoms. I don't have a lot of time to take these because of my schedule, so I don't know how long it will take to get results, but I am very happy with them.
I have been taking this for about 2 weeks and I have noticed a difference. I feel that I am more alert and more able to concentrate.
These are the only ones that I can tolerate and they seem to be working. I had to order the large size to be able to swallow them.

"I liked this product. It helped me to organize some of my bands and it keep them protected from dust. It is a very useful item. I would recommend it.
This is a really nice, well made bag. I use it to carry my mandolin in and out of the house. I like the zippered compartment on the bottom, so I can put my tuner and picks in there.
I was very happy with the purchase of this bag. I use it to carry my mandolin in and out of the house. I like the zippered compartment on the bottom, so I can put my tuner and picks in there. I would recommend this bag to anyone who wants to carry their instrument in a safe and secure way.

"I love this product and make hair grow and it has no scent which make me not get headache. Coconut oil is my treat hair. I can feel the difference and my hair is much more moisturized.
Coconut oil is the best way to make your hair grow. It also helps in nourishing your hair and making them look shiny and healthy. I am using this for a long time now and I can see that my hair is growing faster. I have also stopped getting dandruff as well. It is a must try product for all girls.

This is the only lotion that doesn't make my skin feel like a greasy mess after applying. I use it as my daytime moisturizer and it works perfectly!"
"When I bought the  vivofit 3 I didn't realize how cheap the bands are. This group of 10 bands comes to only $2 apiece and a better wrist clasp. You can change your band to go with your ever changing wardrobe. The band is comfortable and I like the way it fits my wrist. I have had it for a few months and the battery life has been great. I don't need to recharge it every day. It also tracks my sleep. I can tell if I was restless or slept through the night. I like that it doesn't need to be recharged every night. It is easy to use. Just wear it on your wrist. The display is easy to read. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fitness tracker.
I have had the Vivofit 3 for about 2 months now. I have found it to be a great tool for tracking my daily steps. I can see how many steps I have taken in a day and I can also see how many calories I have burned. I can also see how many hours of sleep I have had and how many minutes of exercise I have done. It is very easy to use. I just have to put it on my wrist"
Product does help easy dry skin issues. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin issues. I also use it for my dry hands and it works great.
"Great product. Highly recommend! Very happy with the product, very good quality and the service was excellent. Thanks so much!
The product is great and I love the fact that it is designed in Australia and made in the USA. This is important to me as I don’t want to support the Asian industry. Thank you for your great products.
I am so pleased with my purchase! It is beautiful and the fabric is so soft. I look forward to wearing it. Thank you for your beautiful designs!
I love this dress! The fabric is soft and light and the fit is great. It is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
I love this dress. I bought the blue one for my niece for her wedding. She loved it. I have it in the white and I love it as well. I will be ordering another one in the white.
This dress is amazing! I have it in the blue and white and I love them both. It is very well made and the fit is perfect.

"Seems to work pretty fast! My 3 year old hates getting her temp taken. This seems to be pretty acurate as well. I have 3 thermometers i use to check temps to make sure they are accurate. I have found that this one is just as good as the other 2. I have no idea how it is so fast but it is.
I bought this for my grandson who has a fever. He had a fever for 2 days and the thermometer was so easy to use that I was able to take his temp several times a day. I was so happy to see that the reading stayed the same each time I took it. I was very happy with the price and the service. The thermometer was shipped very quickly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a little one with a fever."
This product helps with muscle soreness and also mitigates side effects from statin.  Great absorption.
"Great shipping, very accurate weight readings -- one problem -- it shows every speck of dust on black surface. The print on the screen is very good and the display is very bright. It's a great addition to my shop. The unit was well packed and it arrived in one piece.
I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. It was easy to use and works great. He can now see the weight of his work piece. He loves it.
I have a shop full of digital scales and this is by far the most accurate. It has a lot of features that I haven't even gotten into yet. I have been waiting for a scale like this for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone that is serious about accurate weights.
We are a full service equipment rental company and this scale is a great addition to our rental inventory. The weight is accurate and the digital readout is easy to read. We rent it out with our air compressors and it works great.
I have used this scale for several months and I am very pleased. I use it for my home repair"
"I like the scent and texture. I was hoping it would make my hair shinier and softer, but I don’t see much of a difference.
I bought this for my daughter. She said it was okay. It did not make her hair shinier or softer. The scent is nice. I have used the product for myself and I like it. I will continue to use it.
I love the smell, texture and how well it works. It does a great job of keeping my hair hydrated. I also like how it smells in my hair. It is a must have in my beauty cabinet.
This is one of my favorite products. I have been using this product for several years. It has a wonderful scent and leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny. I use it every time I wash my hair. I highly recommend this product.

"I bought these pills as I have borderline hypertension (high blood pressure). After reading some studies on the effectiveness of celery on this condition, I figured it was worth a try. Started taking them and after a week I re-checked my blood pressure (As I do every week) and I've gone from 133/85 down to 117/78. Works for me and better than going on the meds for now!"
"Great for massage therapists or anyone who loves massage. She is a great person to talk to. I highly recommend her!
This was my first time using a professional massage service and I have to say that I will definitely be coming back. The massage was very relaxing and the service was excellent. The place was clean and the atmosphere was peaceful. I will definitely be returning!
I was very impressed with the professionalism of the massage therapist and the cleanliness of the office. I highly recommend this establishment.
I have been a client of this massage therapy business for over two years now. I am very pleased with the level of service, the professionalism of the staff, and the results of the treatments. I highly recommend this business.

"Very small, made for small wrists, which I have thank goodness. Don't know if it's accurate. After a while, I'll get an average I suppose. Dr. office readings are much lower, I'll go with that."
"This product is awesome!  Once you get past the taste, the product works very well.  I take it prior to bedtime and I have never slept so well!  I take it with a little water and hold my breath.  It is worth every drop.  The value is great as well.  I have tried supplements without magnesium stearate and they are costly and do not work nearly as well as this.  I am truly amazed by it! I hope it is around for a long time!
I have been using this product for a while now and it has helped me a lot. I had horrible insomnia and was on medication for it. After I started using this product I was able to wean myself off of the medication. I can sleep like a baby now! I am very happy with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has trouble sleeping.
This is a great product. I have tried many different brands of magnesium supplements and they all make me sick. This one is the only one that doesn't make me feel sick. I take this at night before bed and it helps me sleep. I would recommend this product to anyone that has trouble sleeping.
I love this product. I have been using it for a couple of months and I feel like it has helped me a lot. I have noticed that I have been sleeping better and I have been more relaxed. I would recommend this product to anyone who has trouble sleeping.

Order arrived 2 days earlier than estimated delivery! Yay! In a cute pink bag. Excited to try this supplement! Tasteless/No smell--- decently sized but smaller than my prenatal! Not hard for me to swallow.<br /><br />I want twins but I'm excited to try just to get pregnant... I'm on my fourth month trying. Going to give some to a friend who has been trying for 3 years too.
The lighting on the reader is not bright enough.  I would prefer it to be a little brighter for easy reading.
Not sure about this pedometer it appears to count steps with very little movement. I picked it up to attach to my pants and it showed 12 steps. I am going to check the stride count before I update this review but so far not what I had hoped for.

"Good, sturdy digital scale with easy to read numbers. The blue back light easy on the eyes.<br /><br />It's not small though. It's going to need space.<br /><br />The scale is made in China, but it has a warranty in the USA."
"Feels good to give your eyes the nutritional supplements needed for minimizing Macular Degeneration. I have been doing it for years. Vitamin A, C, E, zinc, copper, lutein and zeaxanthin. You can get these in multivitamins, or get them in supplement form. I have been using the lutein and zeaxanthin for the past two years, and the difference is amazing. I have read that it also helps prevent cataracts. Good Luck.
I have been taking an allergy pill called Zyrtec for a long time. Recently I started having a severe reaction to it. My eyes were itchy, watering and red. I was getting headaches, and had a lot of pain in my eyes. I went to an allergist and had a test done. I was told that the allergy pill was causing my reactions. I took a break from taking it for a month. My eyes are getting better, but I am still having a lot of itching and redness. I was wondering if"

"This is the only nutritional supplement I've ever taken for my nails (including gelatin and other products) that really helps. I have dry, splitting nails. And when I take this supplement everyday, my nails grow and get a little stronger. I take 2 a day and notice a difference."
"Excellent quality and price. The material is very soft and comfortable. I bought the size L. I'm 1.70 cm and weigh 70 kg. It is perfect for me. I recommend the product and the seller.
I ordered it in a size XL, my height is 165, weight 65. It fits well, the material is very pleasant. Very satisfied."

The shirt is a little big, but I can live with that. I got a small, so maybe I should have gotten an XS. I love the material and the design, though.

"I know absolutely nothing about nutrition.<br />I'm pregnant with my third child and my husband is the nutrition person in our family. He knows about vitamins and supplements and claims that these are the best value. I believe it's the DHA that he said was pretty impressive. I don't remember the specifics but he looked into the company and how/where they process the vitamins and was impressed. Until further notice, he prefers that we stick to this prenatal option for the rest of the pregnancy and the first year of breastfeeding. I would recommend.<br />
This is the first prenatal I've taken that doesn't make me nauseous. I took the recommended dose of two pills a day. I am very happy with the results. I am having a baby boy. I hope this will help him grow into a healthy baby. I also like that it is an all in one. It has everything you need. I feel like I don't have to take any other vitamins or supplements.<br />
The best prenatal I have ever taken. I did not get the horrible heartburn I always get with other prenatals. I am not sure if it was the extra iron that helped but I was able to take the recommended dose of 2 a day. My doctor was also happy with the results. I took it for 9 months and my baby was very healthy. I will continue to take it during my breastfeeding years.<br />
I had a lot of problems with heartburn and nausea with my first"
"Lo mejor de lo mejor! ¡Si me lo permites, te voy a dar un consejo! Para cuando te toque a ti hacer un regalo a un hombre, como es mi caso, es mejor regalar algo que le guste a él, no a ti, ya que te puede pasar lo que me pasó a mi: me regalaron un cojín de ganchillo y yo, que estoy acostumbrada a hacer ganchillo, lo encuentro muy bonito, pero mi marido no lo tiene en cuenta, no le gusta, así que lo he guardado en una caja para que no me lo vea y no se me olvide que me lo regalaron. Por eso, yo me guiaría por lo que le gusta a él, a no ser que le guste a los dos, claro."
"Works great, made a 2nd order. I will be making a 3rd order soon. This is great product. I like it better than the 4 oz bottles.
Love this stuff! I have been using it for years. The new containers are much better than the old ones. They are not as bulky and they are very easy to open. I will continue to use this product and order it on line. Thanks for a great product."
"I needed a little extra biotin in my life... These do not have a flavor, are tiny and easy to swallow. I have used hairfluence before, and I have used sports research, all are good, but these have a better price. I will continue to buy these
I love these vitamins. I take them every day and have noticed a difference in my hair. It is stronger and grows faster than before. I also take these with a vitamin C supplement and I have noticed that my nails are stronger. I would definitely recommend these vitamins to anyone who wants to grow stronger, shinier hair and nails.
The product is great. I noticed a difference in my hair and nails in only a few weeks. I will be ordering this product again.

"doesn’t read temperatures accurately. waste of money! I have tried everything to calibrate it. It’s either too hot or too cold. I have a couple of other thermometers that I use to calibrate it, but it still isn’t right.
The first time I used it, it was accurate. I would say it was pretty spot on. Now, I have to keep calibrating it and it seems to get more inaccurate the more I use it. I use it to keep track of my baby’s temperature. I’m thinking of buying a new one.
It is very accurate, but the buttons are a bit sensitive and hard to press. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s something to be aware of.
I have a couple of other thermometers in the house and I use them to calibrate this one. This way, I know it’s accurate. It’s always spot on.

"I am not sure if celery seed and celery seed extract are the same thing...but this picture shows extract but it was delivered as just celery seed...I ordered celery seed first from another brand then saw this not realizing it was going to come as the same thing... So I didn't really need to spend the extra money. I am hoping it is the same thing but I will update if I find out otherwise.
This is a new product for me. I think it is a very good product. It has a very strong smell but it is very good for you. I like it and will buy it again. I recommend it.
I received this product as a free sample. I was really excited because I like celery seed but I hate the smell. This product has no smell and tastes great. I will definitely buy this product again.
I am happy with the product. It has a strong celery smell but I think that is part of the reason why it is good for you. I will buy it again.

"I've been using this product for years and panic when I run low.  I previously used a very expensive department store brand but someone suggested Fruit of the Earth.  It's light, doesn't irritate my skin and is certainly the right price.  I use it under my makeup and before I go to bed at night.  I'm happy to say that my skin is really nice because of this product.  It has become difficult to find in local drugstores, however.  I stock up when I find it and especially if it is on sale."

I have not heard of this brand before. But I have heard good things about this brand. I will have to check this out. I am all about being healthy and this would be a great addition to my supplements.
I have not heard of Now foods before but I will have to look into them. I am very interested in trying their supplements. I am always looking for new brands to try. I love how they are affordable. I know I can find them at my local grocery store. I think they would be a great brand for me.

"I've used this product for years. The cost has more than doubled and I may have to discontinue taking it if the price continues to climb. I use a number of supplements daily. I can't tell you if this has made a difference in any specific way. I've stopped taking it a time or two to see if I felt a difference and I didn't and my lab work had no changes. I take it to help my immune system and I think it's a good product.
I have been taking this for a couple of months now and I feel it is helping my immune system. I have not had any colds or flu in the winter, which is unheard of for me. I would definitely recommend this product.

"The scale keeps changing weights when you step on and step off. Also breaks and chips quite easily. I wish I would have spent the extra $10 to buy a better scale. I don't feel like I can trust this scale. I love my fitbit but the scale is a disappointment.
The scale is very accurate. I love the app. It is very easy to use and has a lot of information. It is great to be able to connect with friends and see how they are doing. I am very happy with this scale.
Love the app. It's easy to use. I like the step tracker, calorie counter, and sleep tracker. It is nice to be able to see what I have accomplished. I like the fact that I can see what my friends are doing. I have gotten a lot of use out of the scale. I would recommend this scale to anyone."
"I bought this 4 months ago and it already stopped working. I use it about once weekly, and weigh 125 pounds, so there is no explanation for it to only last for such a short period of time. I have tried using it in the shower, but it still doesn't work. I would give it zero stars if I could.
I love this scale. I bought it because it has Bluetooth. I can weigh myself on my phone without having to stand on a scale. It is easy to set up. The only thing is that it is a little expensive. I also have the Fitbit Aria Air. I like the Fitbit better, but I like this scale because it is more accurate. I don't like the Fitbit because it is inaccurate. I have a small baby, and I like to weigh myself before and after I feed her. The Fitbit would say I gained 5 pounds, and the scale would say I gained .2 pounds. I like the Fitbit because it tracks my steps and calories. The scale does not track steps and calories. The Fitbit is also a little more accurate, but I like the scale better because it is more accurate. I recommend this"
"This was not the correct battery for the claimed Fluke 123 compatibility.<br /><br />First off the connector did not have a polarity tab on the plug and that could potentially allow it to be plugged in backwards. Next off the power and sensor pins were not in the correct positions within the plug so no matter which way it was plugged in it would not work.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took matters into my own hands and rebuilt my old battery pack using the cells in this &#34;kit&#34; to try and make a good battery pack. It will power the meter but will never indicate charged. Not sure if the meter was damaged by trying this pack as shipped or if I have done something wrong.<br /><br />I think the worst part is a month or so later this seller called my cell phone. Apparently they noticed that this was delivered to a business address, assumed incorrectly that this was a business order and wanted to set up an account. I explained that this was a private order, the package was delivered to my home and that this was a private purchase. I also explained that I would not be purchasing from them again and that I had already recommended to anyone that would listen that they avoid this seller.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if the seller can be contacted as I did not leave a number with them and I do not have the email address. I&#39;m not sure if they are even still in business.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Fluke 123 battery pack this is not the one to buy. I&#39;m not sure what the seller was trying to do but I can only assume that it was to sell a product that is not compatible with the Fluke 123 meter.<br /><br />Fluke 123 Battery Pack

I have been using this for a few months now and I love it. I have really sensitive skin and I have found this serum to be very gentle on my skin. It has helped with my acne scars and overall skin tone. I am very happy with this product.
This is a great serum! I have been using it for about 2 months and have noticed my skin looks brighter and more even. My dark spots are fading and my skin is softer. I also use it before applying my makeup. It gives my skin a nice glow.

"It arrived fine. It works good. It's a little to big for my bathroom. I would recommend this product to anyone.
Good quality and works well. I got the 12.5 gallon model and it is a bit big for my bathroom. I would recommend the 10 gallon model.
Great value. I had purchased this unit previously for another bathroom and the new unit is just as good as the first. I would definitely recommend this product.
This is a great unit, I had it installed in my bathroom and it has been working great. It is a little bigger than I expected, but it works great.
Very happy with this unit. It is much larger than I thought it would be but it works great and is quiet. It is a little more expensive than some other units but it is well worth it.
Great for my bathroom. I was very happy with this unit. It has a good amount of space and it is quiet. I would recommend this to anyone.

I have been using this product for about 3 years now. I have been very happy with the results. My hair is not as dry and brittle and my nails are stronger and growing. I take it daily. I have been ordering from this company for the last 5 years. I have always received my order promptly and have never had any problems. I would recommend this product and this company to anyone looking for a good multivitamin.
I love this product, it works for me! I have been taking it for years, and I am so glad I found it. My hair and nails have gotten thicker and healthier, and my skin has become smoother. I feel better overall, and I love that I don't have to take any other supplements. I would recommend this to everyone!

"My 5-year old daughter will take these no problem.  They have a chalky taste, but better taste than other brands we have tried."
I’ve tried other brands and have finally settled on Atlantic. Not only are the capsules a fraction of the size but they’re far more effective. These have really helped me along with b12 and extra D3. I’m so grateful to be able to purchase at a reasonable price and have these perform as advertised!
"My PT friend (a woman) takes this brand for her.  I was glad to see they have one for men.  After looking at it, it has more than the amount of vitamins I need. As an RN student I've learned that certain vitamins are needed for the body to function correctly....and certain important ones must be consumed.  And since I usually eat the same foods everyday Im not sure if Im getting them all. This takes all the headaches and worry away.  Just 1 once per day with my morning meal and I am set for entire day!  I found that one bottle lasts me around 30 days as its only 1 ounce per day.  Great stuff and I already ordered my 2nd bottle."
"Not exactly what was expected. Very hard, not ply-able replacement ear pieces. The black trim around the speaker is a soft rubber. The rest of the speaker is a hard plastic. No instructions on how to replace the ear pieces, but I believe that they should be the same as the original. I also had a problem with the speaker not connecting to the phone. I had to remove the speaker from the case to connect it. I am not happy with this purchase.
I am happy with this speaker but the microphone is not good. It picks up my voice and sounds like I am talking through a tin can."
"This device might look and feel nice. But when you step on it, it's as if the glass was going to break underneath you. The scale is not accurate, I know I'm in the 150lb-170lb range but the scale first showed 178lb then it showed 154lb then it showed 144lb and every time it changes dramatically. As well when you step on it the LCD that shows the weight blurs out making it hard to read.<br />Do your self a favor and spend an extra $10 or so on a good scale. Will be returning this scale.<br />
Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Scale! I bought this scale to replace an old one that I had in the bathroom. The new scale is much more sturdy and is much easier to read. The digital numbers are very large and easy to read. I would highly recommend this scale to anyone looking for a new scale.

"It only worked for a week, then I got a very strange error message. It was a problem with the hardware, so I returned it to Amazon. I bought a new one, which was delivered to me within a week. The new one worked for two days and then I got the same error message. So I contacted Amazon, and they sent me a replacement. That one worked for a few days and then I got the same error message. So, I contacted Amazon again, and they sent me a third one. That one works fine, but I think it’s on borrowed time."
"Love these! Within a week I was feeling more energetic and my skin also looked and felt nicer. I overall have felt a lot more upbeat and grounded since taking these. I was having fatigue, was anemic, and also having brain fog. I started taking these and it’s all been so much better. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the first time I took them I had an upset stomach, but that was the only time. I did get some heartburn though, so I had to take them with food. I will definitely continue to take them!
These are great for my mood. I have a very stressful job and tend to have low energy and depression. These help me stay more positive and have more energy throughout the day. I like to take them before bed to help me sleep better too.
I’ve been taking these for a week now and I feel great. My skin is looking better, I have more energy and my hair is growing like crazy! I love these vitamins!"
I love the One n Only - I will never change it! I highly recommend this vitamin to all. Go Get It!

"this great deal and great energy for the long days at work and the
evenings at home. She was a busy woman, and the little ones were
dressed, the dinner prepared, and the house in order, before she
herself had time to eat her own breakfast. She was always on time, and
was often in the office of the _Chicago Herald_ before her husband had
finished his breakfast.

The children were always in school by nine o'clock, and the morning
hours of the mother were devoted to the care of her home. She was
very particular about the food that her family ate, and insisted that
they should have plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit. She was very
fond of canning her own fruit, and she often made her own preserves.
She also kept a few chickens and a couple of hens, and was always
ready to make good fresh butter and cheese.

Waste of my hard earned money 💰. ☹ I need omegas and thought this would be the best method. Doubt they'll refund my money. I hope you all get better results.

I’m pretty sure this supplement does what it is supposed to do but I can’t stand the taste. It added a weird sort of pungent eggy taste to my electrolyte drink. I would have preferred to drink it with water but it was so strong and bad I couldn’t do it.
"I bought this to help me prepare my skin (I deal with itchtyosis 2 winters ago) and hair for the winter. I love the flavor, though it has a mild egg aftertaste and that's just because of the borage oil. I feel like I am nourishing my skin from within. I also love that I don't have to worry about the omega 3s being rancid. I can't wait to start my second bottle!

"We are having trouble getting pregnant and our fertility doctor told us about 4 months ago to start prenatals and that for the time being it could be anything that I could tolerate. I tried to other brands and I ended up with horrible headaches, nauseated, and upset stomach. I also have Celiac so trying to find a GF prenatal is harder than I thought. I could not be more thankful to have found this one by Vimerson! It is awesome and I don't get sick in any way, shape, or form. Highly recommend for anyone having a difficult time with finding a prenatal that your body agrees with! Thank you!
I was feeling very stressed out and anxious before taking this product. It helped calm me down and relax. I also noticed a difference in my mood.
I am a competitive dancer and I have been taking this product for a year and a half now. I am in college and I am on a strict diet, and I have to take a lot of supplements. This is the only prenatal that I can take and still maintain my strict diet. I love how it has no sugar, no artificial colors, and no artificial flavors. It is easy to digest and I feel amazing when I take it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a prenatal supplement!
This product is great for a pregnant women. It has all the ingredients that you need. I like that it is organic and gluten free. It is a great product.
I have been using this product for a month and I can feel the difference. I have more energy and my hair and nails"
"My husband likes this one the best! It’s just a little bit of a deeper, richer flavor, and I like it! I think he likes it because he knows he’s getting the good stuff in there!
We’ve done a lot of work on the house and garden this year. We’ve added a couple of new beds, and we’ve got a lot of weeding and planting to do in the next few weeks. I’m hoping to get a lot of those weeds out before we get a late frost, or I will be one sad woman!
I’ve also been busy with my freelance writing, and I’ve been working on a couple of new articles. One is for the Spring edition of The Old Farmer’s Almanac, and I am really excited about it! I don’t know when it will be published, but I’m really looking forward to it!
I’m also working on a couple of new articles for the next issue of the Missouri Master Gardener magazine. It should be coming out in October, and"

"I’ve been a mom for almost 36 years. In that time, I’ve owned and used A LOT of thermometers.  This is one of the best I’ve ever used. Want to know why? For one thing, the tip at the end is flexible. When using it on myself, I found this to be WONDERFUL! I have a VERY SERIOUS gag reflex. Most thermometers make me gag because when they’re up under my tongue they just always seem to push that special button that makes me…uck. BUT, with this one, I was able to bend it just a little—keeping it up under my tongue—but it pushed down instead of back and…tada!...no gagging. LOVE THAT. Another thing that just amazed me was how accurate it seemed to be. The first day I got it, I took my temperature 10 times throughout the day. Mind you, I was not sick. Just testing it out. It read between 98.3 and 98.8 all day; pretty steady. THEN, a few days later, my husband got sick. He had a high temp. We took a reading at 11:00 pm that read 102.3. The next day we took him to the doctor. HER thermometer read 102.1. If it’s reading the same as the doctor’s, I would take that to mean it’s accurate. One last thing and then I’ll stop gushing. I LOVE the little happy/not happy faces on the read out. CUTE. But, practical too. My grandson is 8. He looked at the thermometer after taking a daytime temp for my husband and said, “Grammy, there’s a sad face. That means Papaw is really sick!” LOVE IT! So, if you are looking for a thermometer, look no further. I think you’ll love it as much as I do."
"Wonderful product, great price, arrived in perfect condition! This is my second purchase and will continue to purchase. I use it for all my family and friends.
Love this product. I started using it in my hair and it has really helped it grow. I use it in my hair as a leave in conditioner. My hair is thicker and healthier. I also use it in my face and it has helped my skin. I have noticed less breakouts and my skin is softer.
I was skeptical when I first got this. But I have used it for a couple weeks now and my skin is so soft. I have never seen my skin so soft. I even use it in my hair. I love this product.
I have very sensitive skin and this product has been wonderful for my face. I use it after I cleanse and tone and my face feels so soft and smooth. I also use it as a leave in conditioner in my hair and it has helped my hair grow faster. I will continue to use this"
"Naturalist had me to order it, can't tell if it's helping, bit will finish bottle
Morning guys! Has anyone had success with the new zpacks zpacs? Just wondering if they are worth it. I have the zpacs from the old zpacks website, and I have to say I have been very happy with them. But, the new zpacs look a lot better. I really like the new zpac zippered side pockets and the new material. But, I'm not sure if I should be spending more money on them. I use my packs a lot, so I think the zpacs should hold up pretty well. Any thoughts? Thanks

I have a few zpacs, but I'm not sure I can speak for the new ones. The old ones have held up fine, and they have a lifetime warranty. I can attest that zpacs"
